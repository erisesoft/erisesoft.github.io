## Brief
* eRisemail system offers a feature with which user can extend or append the Anti-spam engines.
* Engine is based on C or C++, as the dynamic librarys, a .so file, on Linux.

## How to use
1. Implement the features which you desire based on the framework codes(the code is in antispam directory).
2. Compile to generate the engine - a .so file.
3. For the security consideration, please stop the eRisemail service.
4. Append a record of engine to eRisemail Filter List, _`/etc/erisemail/mfilter.xml`_
5. Start the eRisemail service

### Description of Filter List `/etc/erisemail/mfilter.xml`
* This XML file storages all eRisemail Filter engines
* All the engines that are listed will be invoked in any new MTA session (SMTP session) .
* The invoked order follows the order listed in the XML file.
libso refers to the path of the engine.
* action means how to handle the spammail:
  * TAG will only toggle this mail as a spam, but still recieves and storages the mail.
  * DROP will discard spam mail directly .
* param means the paramter for the filter
